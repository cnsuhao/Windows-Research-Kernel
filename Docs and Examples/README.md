This directory contains the document "Getting Started with the WRK", the original NT kernel design workbook, and the documentation and source code for an example student project using the Windows Research Kernel (WRK).

It is recommended the install script ..\WRKInstall.bat be used to install the contents of this directory rather than copying them directly from the DVD. The exercises described by the documents in this directory assume the PC environment has been configured by WRKInstall.bat and all WRK related components have been installed accordingly.

Information on the "NT Design Workbook":
The original NT design workbook written 1989-1993 has been included on this DVD. These documents describe many the of the native NT kernal APIs that are still in use today and shed light on many of the design decisions from when it was first created.

Information on the "Getting Started with the WRK":
This document describes how to modify the WRK and boot from it within a Virtual PC 2007 virtual machine, connect the Windows Debugger (WinDbg) to that virtual machine, and to complete a simple WRK debugging exercise using WinDbg.

Information on the "Fair Share Scheduler Example Project":
This is an example student project created by Dr. Marty Humphrey from the University of Virgina in June 2007. It is an expansion of a project he had the students in his operating systems fundamentals course complete Fall term of 2006. It provides thorough directions to beginning students of an operating systems course on WRK scheduler theory and the steps necessary to modify the WRK to have a "Fair Share Scheduler". The project includes links to an application to test the scheduler efficiency as well as the WRK files that were modified to implement the "Fair Share Scheduler."

It is recommended that users who are new to the WRK complete the steps described in "Getting Started with the WRK" before attempting the "Fair Share Scheduler" project.
